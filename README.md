# tools used

The base of our platform is chatter on framework which supports NLU like api.ai and wit.ai and provides easy deployment avoiding struggle of deployment and integration of NLU apis with backend scripts.
Chatter on uses apis to deal with dynamic data of any type. Following are the apis we used:

``prepared a api from scrapped data of justdial (eg. http://twg-api.herokuapp.com/api/dial?city=ludhiana&category=police which has been deployed along with one of applications.)``
`` used sheetsu api for converting google sheets as api``
`` other apis used are: mapmyindia api, pricetree api, pricecheckindia api, food2fork recipe api and many more.``

Currently we are storing data in google sheets using sheetsu api and fetching it for use by various purposes.
